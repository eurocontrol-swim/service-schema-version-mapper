    "serviceAbstract": "<p>This Service is part of Coflight Cloud Services (CCS), which are primarily designed to support the Virtual Centre concept. As such, these CCS Services support the interactions between the CCS ATM Data Service Provider (ADSP) and Virtual Centre Air Traffic Service Units (ATSUs). The CCS FlightDataDistribution service is consistent with the other CCS services. It supports:<\/p><p>- the distribution of Flight Plan information every time an update of a relevant Flight Plan is processed by the ADSP. The modifications of the Flight Plans can be triggered from several sources (other CWPs or functionality of the ADSP).<\/p><p>- The distribution of Erroneous AFTN messages information referred to FDO for manual correction, every time an AFTN message reception fails Coflight checks. This version of the service is intended to be used in 'test mission', which aims at providing services and support to the Customer(s) to enable them to test any version of their ATM system during development.<\/p>",

The message payloads are encoded following a protobuf format. The message exchange patterns used by the CCS services are request\/reply and publish\/subscribe. The CCS customer acts as requester and subscriber. The CCS provider acts as responder and publisher.Concerning publish-subscribe, the CCS customer subscribes to a CCS distribution service by directly listening to an appropriate AMQP topic, which name follows the CCS derivation rules.The subscription to CCS Distribution Services is not performed via subscription operations, but by connecting to the appropriate AMQP Topic described in the .protobuf files as topic:\/\/<NameSpaceName>.<ServiceInterfaceName>.<LogicalOperation>The subscribers can filter the messages they want to receive by using the filter parameters defined for each subscription operation.Please note that, after subscribing to a CCS Distribution Service, the current repository of messages needs to be obtained from CCS via the get<MessageRepository> operation defined for each CCS Distribution Service(see \"Subscription\" section of the distribution operation of the service).N.B:-If the CCS platform restarts while the Customer is connected to the AMQP Broker, the current repository of messages is published again.-The acknowledgement that a Customer receives to his request (\"RequestReport\") may be received after the data distribution that this request has triggered, as these two messages are managed asynchronously by AMQP Queues and Topics.-More generally, since the distribution events from different services are asynchronous (independent CORRD\/FDD... topics), they may be received in an unexpected sequence during a short time (a few ms) before reaching consistency.Concerning request-reply the CCS customer sends a request by sending a message to an appropriate AMQP queue, which name follows the CCS derivation rules, to make a request. The request message contains the name of the queue into the CCS customer listens and in which the reply from the CCS provider is expected."
